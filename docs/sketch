search for reqs(not in scheduled_reqs)

if no req: do nothing
if one req: req = this req
if two req: req = req of shorter finding length

NEW_COMMAND(req_from_floor, 0) # wait time ignored for now
scheduled_reqs.add(req) # TODO we should del this later
dst_list.add(req_to_floor)


1. modify commandList according to req's from and to floor
	- if from floor and direction are the same, do nothing
2. scheduled.add()
3. commandList.nextCommand() will find the next
newCommand:(dst, 0)
set the dst to the floor of the first found item below:
a. from the current floor, to the current direction:
look for a U/D same as the current direction; or an O
if unable, look for a U/D of different direction
b. if still unable, look to the reversed direction:
look for a U/D same as the current direction; or an O
if unable, look for a U/D of different direction
c. if nothing found, do not give a command
